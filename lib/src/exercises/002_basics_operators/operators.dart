  // 1. You bought coffee for 3.65 and cake for 4.35. How much did you spend?

  // 2. You have 50.0 and you want to buy 3 coffees for 3.65 each. How much money do you have left?

  // 3. You have 100$. You want to split it between your family members. Your kid gets 20%, your wife 30% and you keep
  //    the rest. How much money does each of you get?

  // 4. Find all numbers between 1 and 20 that are divisible by 3 and 2. (use % operator - remainder of the division)

  // 5. Now count how many numbers between 1 and 20 are divisible by 3 and 2. (use counter variable and ++ operator)

  // 6. Create a small game where you roll a dice (1-6) and move your player on a board from 0 to 100 position.
  //    If you roll a number divisible by 3, you go one step back (use -- operator). Otherwise you go one step forward
  //    (use ++ operator).
  //    For dice roll you can use this random number generator snippet:
  //    var rnd = Random();
  //    var dice = rnd.nextInt(6) + 1;

  // 7. Find sum of all numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 3 and 2. (use += operator)

  // 8. Create a function that accepts String and returns same string or "UNDEFINED" if string is null.
  //    (use ??= operator)
